# weekies_app
A Program to help select 2 people to do chores for the upcoming week (we call them weekies).
Here is the guideline for selecting weekies:
1. Because we try to encourage members from different departments to work together, the 2 weekies need to be from different departments
2. It chooses people so that no one is assigned as a weekie too frequently
3. The 2 weekies need to be available for the upcoming week, need to check Google calendar (will modify it so that the user does not need to look at Google Calendar)
