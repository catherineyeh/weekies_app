# task_scheduling_app
A Program to help select 2 people to do chores for the upcoming week (we call them weekies).
Here is the guideline for selecting weekies:
1. Because we try to encourage members from different departments to work together, the 2 weekies need to be from different departments
2. It chooses people so that no one is assigned as a weekie too frequently
3. The 2 weekies need to be available for the upcoming week, need to check Google calendar 

Get it running on your computer:
1. git clone https://github.com/catherineyeh/weekies_app.git
2. Pay attention to the excel file you are reading from.
3. If there are members to be added or deleted, do it directly on the excel file.
